Lua scripts for the Tabletop Caps mod on the Warhammer II workshop

Object model files are found in script/_lib/mod and have no game impact, nor track any data, without implementation.


Implementation files are found in script/campaign/mod, which set up listeners and helper functions to track and enforce unit caps.

Content is found in export helper files.
